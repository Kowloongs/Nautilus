Release notes for FreeBSD 13.1.

This file describes new user-visible features, changes and updates relevant to
users of binary FreeBSD releases.  Each entry should describe the change in no
more than several sentences and should reference manual pages where an
interested user can find more information.  Entries should wrap after 80
columns.  Each entry should begin with one or more commit IDs on one line,
specified as a comma separated list and/or range, followed by a colon and a
newline.  Entries should be separated by a newline.

Changes to this file should not be MFCed.

33ff39796ffe,8719e8a951b7:
        A new rc(8) service script zfskeys allows for automatic decryption
        of ZFS datasets encrypted with ZFS native encryption during boot.
        See the rc.conf(5) manual page for more information.

b7a2cf0d9102 - eae02d959363:
	Upgrade bhyve's emulation to version 1.4 of the NVMe specification

0a6760a1de32, 3f3676a71266, 580c04df4db6:
	Add WiFi 6 support.

various:
	Add support for the HiFive Unmatched RISC-V board.

9fb6e613373c:
	Add a sysctl called vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio that can be used to
	increase the NFS server's maximum I/O size from 128Kbytes
	to any power of 2 up to 1Mbyte.  It can only be set when
	the nfsd threads are not running and will normally require
	an increase in kern.ipc.maxsockbuf to at least the value
	recommended by the console log message generated when
	setting vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio is first attempted.

9ec7dbf46b0a:
	Add a new NFSv4.1/4.2 mount option "nconnect" that can
	be used to specify the number of TCP connections that
	will be used for the mount, up to a maximum of 16.
	The first (default) TCP connection will be used for
	all RPCs that consist of small RPC messages.
	The RPCs that can consist of large RPC messages
	(Read/Readdir/ReaddirPlus/Write) will be sent on the
	additional TCP connections in a round robin fashion.
	If either the NFS client or NFS server have multiple
	network interfaces aggregated together or a network
	interface that uses multiple queues, this can increase
	NFS performance for the mount.

various:
	One True Awk has been updated to the latest from upstream
	(20210215). All the FreeBSD patches, but one, have now been
	either up streamed or discarded.  Notable changes include:
		o Locale is no longer used for ranges
		o Various bugs fixed
		o Better compatibility with gawk and mawk

	The one FreeBSD change, likely to be removed in FreeBSD 14, is that
	we still allow hex numbers, prefixed with 0x, to be parsed and
	interpreted as hex numbers while all other awks (including one
	true awk now) interpret them as 0 in line with awk's historic
	behavior.

8a04edfdcbd2:
	Change the default minor version used for an NFSv4 mount
	to the highest minor version supported by the NFSv4 server.
	This default can be overridden by using the "minorversion"
	mount option.

2c76eebca71b, 59f6f5e23c1a:
	Add two daemons rpc.tlsclntd(8) and rpc.tlsservd(8) that provide
	support for NFS-over-TLS as described in the Internet Draft titled
	"Towards Remote Procedure Call Encryption By Default".
	These daemons are only built when WITH_OPENSSL_KTLS is specified
	and are only tested on amd64 at this time.
	They use KTLS to encrypt/decrypt all NFS RPC message traffic, plus
	optional verification of machine identity via X.509 certificates.
